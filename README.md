## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER

This project was initially built for my personal education, as I was studying mobile requests using mitmproxy, and python requests and automation vs a bigger corporation with higher end security and a multi-step authentication process. That being said, this project is not intended to be used whatsoever as it is against Ubers TOS, and it is purely and only for educational purposes.
